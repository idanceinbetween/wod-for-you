# Flatiron W.O.D.
A app that suggests tailored workout routines for aspiring coders.
(Ok, this is actually a project for Module 1 at Flatiron School.)

## Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges TBC
There are no badges for this project.

## Visuals TBC
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
After you've downloaded the entire project folder, open up your Terminal. Everything will run from there.
If you are not sure how to use Terminal, take a look at this documentation: https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line.
Once in the terminal and navigated to the project folder:
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `/bin/run.rb`
Then off you go!

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
You could find the authors at george.wong@flatironschool.com or jiaxuan.hon@flatironschool.com.

## Authors and acknowledgment
The authors are George Wong and JiaXuan Hon from Inglorious Bashterds of Flatiron School in London.
